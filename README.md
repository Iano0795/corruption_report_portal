## Introduction
The **Corruption Report Portal** is a platform that allows users to anonymously report instances of corruption. The system ensures the safety and anonymity of reporters, while enabling authorities to receive, review, and take action based on the reports submitted.

This project allows users to submit corruption reports and optionally upload supporting evidence (photos or videos). The reports are stored in a database, and the uploaded media files are handled securely. It also includes user authentication for administrators to manage the reports.

## Features
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Submit corruption reports without revealing your identity.
- **Media Uploads**: Upload images or videos to strengthen your report (optional).
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile and desktop-friendly user interface.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for administrators.
- **Database Storage**: All reports and user information are stored in a MySQL database.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for invalid file uploads and report submission issues.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **File Uploads**: Multer (for handling media uploads)
- **User Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing, express-session for session management

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and running
- Git (optional for version control)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/corruption-report-portal.git
cd corruption-report-portal
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your MySQL credentials:
```
HOST=localhost
USER=root
PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
```

### 4. Set up the database
The application will automatically create a MySQL database and the necessary tables on first run. Ensure your MySQL server is running, then:

```bash
npm start
```

This will set up the database and create the necessary tables (e.g., `report`, `users`).

### 5. Run the server
After setting up the database, you can start the server by running:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:4300`.

## Usage

### Submitting a Report
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4300`.
2. Fill out the corruption report form with details such as the accused person, incident description, and location.
3. Optionally upload supporting evidence (images/videos) in the form.
4. Click **Submit** to send the report.

### Admin Login
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/login`.
2. Enter the admin credentials to access the dashboard and view submitted reports.

### File Uploads
- The system accepts image (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`) and video (`mp4`, `mov`) files.
- Maximum file size is limited to **10 MB** per upload.
- Uploaded media files are stored in the `/uploads` directory.

## API Endpoints
